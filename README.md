# Codesphere RPC
Codesphere RPC is a modern, modular open source RPC framework for Typescript, which abstracts away HTTP and WebSocket and lets you write code as if there was no network layer in between.

It is intended for fullstack microservice applications and optimized for usage with DI containers (see: [inversify.js](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS)).

Codesphere RPC is built on top of [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) and [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) for node and the [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) and [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) API's in the browser.

The [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) app can be used outside Codesphere RPC if needed (e.g. to comply with the requirements of external integrations).

## WIP

* CLI generation
* API Documentation generation as a tsc compile step
* Implementations for other languages
* 100% test coverage
* Tutorials and more documentation
